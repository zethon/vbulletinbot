## Instant message interface bot for vBulletin ##

vbulletinbot allows users to read messages and make new posts on a vBulletin messageboard through instant messaging.

**GTalk** and **AIM** are supported. **YIM!** is planned to be supported.

The bot-server is written in C# using the .NET 4.0 framework. The vBulletin plugin is written in PHP using NuSOAP to expose the services.
